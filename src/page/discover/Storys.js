              The cooperative operates in its catchment of 14 revenue villages with a total of 18 gram panchayats. These villages then were in the drought prone region characterized by uplands and hillocks. There were conditions of lack of irrigation facilities,power supply, finance, agri-inputs, remunerative price for their produce. These situations made our ancestors build a temple of trust with a primary objective of countering these challenges and hardships faced by farmers.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed cursor-default">
              Initially founded with 373 members and a share capital of RS 2300/- today society is 7629 active members strong with share capital of 17.96 crores and thrift deposits of 45.90 crores creating impact in the lives of 35000-40000 people. The present admission number of the society is 14908. The annual turnover is around 352 crores which displays the humongous success achieved and much more to come along.
